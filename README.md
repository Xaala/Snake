# Purpose 
This is my first forray into graphical applications in Java. It uses a few deprecated technologies (mainly, Java Applet which has been dropped by pretty much every browser) but was a fun exercise nonetheless.

# Credit 
This game is based off the Khron's YouTube tutorial for a [single player version of Snake](https://youtu.be/9eQJAWhRHQg) but features a handful of new features such as better goal token location, code that supports 1+N players as well as better collision detection.
